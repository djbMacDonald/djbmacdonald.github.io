<div> <div class="education"> <h1>My Education</h1> <p class="about">At the beginning of this year I enrolled in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. In WDI we studied full-time, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks. The course focused on Ruby on Rails and Javascript. Beyond that we were exposed to the Front End Frameworks Angular and Backbone, as well as the testing tools to ensure that our code actually functioned.</p> <p class="about">Before WDI I recieved a BA in Political Science from the University of Chicago. It gave me a chance to study complex systems, build analytical abilty, and hone my communication skills.</p> <img class="university" src="/images/chicago.bd1515c4.jpg"> </div> </div>
