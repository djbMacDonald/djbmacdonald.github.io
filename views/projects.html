<h1>Some of my Work</h1> <div class="project"> <img src="/images/cathedral.svg.af95d99f.png"> <h2>Cathedral</h2> <p>For my WDI final prject I made this fractal generator. The main goal was to explore D3.js as a tool to visualize data. Users can drag and drop nodes to create a seed shape. The program uses a replacement algorithm to return an array of points which D3 draws out. The returned image is zoomable and pannable. The app itself is built on Angular.js.</p> </div> <div class="project"> <img src="/images/vs.9ff94633.png"> <h2>Pixelect</h2> <p>For the WDI group project I worked with 2 other students to create this image tournament app. The main goal of this project was to practice collaborative coding using GitHub. The app uses JS and Handlerbars.js on the front end, Rails as an API, and AWS S3 for image storage. Users upload sets of images and the community can vote, tournament style, on which they like best. Tournaments are closed to voting after 24 hours, but are open to commenting indefinitely.</p> </div> <div class="project"> <img src="/images/checkers.203d1312.png"> <h2>Toroidal Checkers</h2> <p>This is a checkers variant built with JavaScript. The board is imagined to wrap around on both axes, effectively turning a plane into a torus.</p> </div> <div class="project"> <img src="/images/pikemen.394d4172.png"> <h2>Pikemen Project</h2> <p>This was my first project for WDI. It is a full stack Rails app. The primary goal was to demonstrate CRUD actions. The app is styled as a hypothetical interface for a project to create a grassroots database of police homicide. A user can create anonymous reports. Members of the project would verify reports. Only verfied reports would be publicly viewable. **Note: This database is hypothetical, it is not being actively maintained.**</p> </div>
